# Filefile

Filefile is a file used to keep track of all the files you have in your repository’s root directory that end in `file`.

## Wait, what?

The root directories of countless projects across the interwebs are littered with equally countless Filefiles. I find this somewhat entertaining, because it’s inherently obvious that they’re all files.

## What should go in your Filefile

Here is what your average project’s `Filefile` might look like:

```
Gemfile
Rakefile
Procfile
Makefile
Guardfile
Blakefile
Knylefile
Filefile
Vagrantfile
Tenderfile
```

Yes, your Filefile should include itself at the end. Deal with it.
